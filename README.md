# What is LDA?

LDA stands for Linear Discriminant Analysis and is a type of classification algorithm. It is based on bayes theorem and distribution of data. The fundamental difference between LDA and Logistic regression is that Logistic regression directly models the probability of a data point being in a certain class:
 **P(y=k|X=x)** 
whereas the LDA classifier tries to find this probability using the Bayes theorem
